ADP (Alignment Delegation Protocol) System Overview (v01)

This is a comprehensive web application that implements the Alignment Delegation Protocol (ADP), a system designed for intelligent routing and delegation of queries to specialized narrow models (NMs). The system functions as a demonstration platform for AI model coordination, featuring real-time monitoring, health tracking, and message routing capabilities.

The application serves as both a working implementation of ADP and a live demonstration environment, allowing users to submit queries that are intelligently routed to appropriate narrow models based on domain expertise, current load, and health status.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

System Architecture
Frontend Architecture
The client is built as a modern React single-page application using TypeScript and Vite for development. The UI leverages shadcn/ui components built on Radix primitives for accessibility and consistency. The application uses TanStack Query for efficient server state management and Wouter for lightweight client-side routing.

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with specialized components for different aspects of the ADP system:

Real-time dashboard with WebSocket connectivity for live updates
Interactive query interface supporting multiple domains and priorities
Visual routing diagrams showing delegation flow
Health monitoring displays for narrow model status
Message format viewers for ADP protocol compliance
Backend Architecture
The server implements a REST API using Express.js with TypeScript, following a modular service-oriented design. The core routing logic is encapsulated in an ADPRouter service that handles intelligent delegation decisions based on narrow model availability, load balancing, and domain expertise.

The backend uses an in-memory storage implementation (with interfaces designed for easy database migration) and includes WebSocket support for real-time updates to connected clients. The routing system implements multiple delegation strategies including round-robin, weighted distribution, and health-aware routing.

Data Storage Solutions
Currently implements an in-memory storage system using TypeScript Maps for development and demonstration purposes. The storage interface is designed with database migration in mind, supporting future PostgreSQL integration through Drizzle ORM.

The schema defines core entities including narrow models, query sessions, responses, coordination logs, and system statistics. All data models use Zod for runtime validation and type safety.

Real-time Communication
WebSocket integration provides live updates for system monitoring, query processing status, and coordination agent logs. The WebSocket implementation includes automatic reconnection logic and message broadcasting to all connected clients.

Authentication and Authorization
The current implementation focuses on the core ADP functionality without authentication. The message format specifications include OAuth2 token placeholders and user context fields for future security implementation.

API Design
RESTful API endpoints handle:

Narrow model management and health monitoring
Query submission and session tracking
System statistics and coordination logs
Real-time routing decisions and delegation results
The API uses consistent error handling, request logging, and JSON response formatting throughout.
