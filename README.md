# Artificial Soveregin Intelligence Cluster Project
This is an open-source Artificial Soveregin Intelligence Cluster (ASIC) repo for designs, code, and processes under a unified AI ecosystem framework. Its' main goal is to engineer alignment where possible to compliment model alignment R&D efforts.

The goal of this project is to prove that universally trusted AI alignment can only be achieved via universal data governance and transparency, since there can be no trust between humanity and AI without transparency. That will be a long journey in terms of data privacy since there are limits to what individuals and organizations will share. So this framework incorporates federated data, established guardrails, and will seek to incorporate new ones.    

This repo is meant for community shares on any of these topics to make the ASIC project as comprehensive as possible. Feel free to reach out on X (@am_of_tx) or Linkedin (/in/amoftx) if you would like to contribute directly to ASIC or have any questions or comments.  You can also reachout @ https://asicp.com
